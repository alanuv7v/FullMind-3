# FullMind
FullMind is a __web-app__ that creates a __multi-dimensional space of your thoughts.__\
In the space, you can __express, connect & explore your thoughts organically.__

## Core Ideas
* Classification
* Organic exploration
* Fluid I/O and user experience

## Features
* Create a network space of your thoughts
* Exploration in the network along a specific and meaningful relation
* Make templates of your thought, and derivative of a template

* Note app
